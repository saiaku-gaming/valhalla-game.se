The big work continues! The rewrite to c++ is still ongoing and it will continue for quite some time. 

<!--excerpt_separator-->


In this month a lot of the features we are currently implementing is things that already existed, things that where previously implemented in blueprint so a rewrite was needed. It's a bit of a boring work, but hopefully we can soon be making new content again. And this time on a much more stable base.


Some other things that are happening right now but not shown in the game is a major cleanup of files. We are slowly moving through the game removing all the old stuff that we no longer need. Supprisingly this is not as easy as it sounds as the game engine (Unreal) is not really up to the task. 


<div style="float: right; text-align: center; margin: 1em 0 1em 1em">
	<img style="width:30em; margin: 0;" src="/images/posts/september1.png" />
	<br />
	*Friends and Chat, Whoho, we can be social again!*
</div>

While we are rewriting stuff we are also revisiting the UI a bit while we implement Party, Chat and Friends so it is consistent with the character screen shown last month. It is also a lot prettier than our last iteration!

This month contains some dealings with bureaucrazy [sic] some some rewrites of code and a whole new way of killing vikings vikings!

## Certificates and funny Americans

I can't help to wonder if all Americans goes around with their gas-bill in thier back pocket instead of an ID as Comodo seems to think that a gas-bill is the best way to prove who you are...




## Don't just stick 'em with the pointy end, shot 'em with it!

Yeah, we introduced a bow and arrow into the game! *Happyness ensured!*




## Major rewrite is on the way

Blueprint is awesome, but some flaws exists and now we are trying to transition from "buggy and quick" to "stable and quick enough" when it comes to development.

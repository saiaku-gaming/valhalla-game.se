Certificate story here

<!--excerpt_separator-->

Apparently the anti virus programs aren't too keen on accepting .exe-files which don't have a valid certificate, so we've been working on getting one of those. However, getting one wasn't as straight forward as one might expect. For example, I can't help but wonder if all Americans go around with their gas-bills in their back pocket instead of an ID as Comodo seems to think that a gas-bill is the best way to prove who you are.

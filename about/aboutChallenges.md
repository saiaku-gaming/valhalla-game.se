According to the norse lore the fallen vikings do two things in Valhall: fight and drink, and what better way to prove your worth by accepting incredibly difficult challenges from the gods themselves? These challenges will span across all over Yggdrasil, from the depths of Hel to the giants' lands of Jotunheim to the Æsirs' home world of Asgård.

The goal of these challenges will be to push not only your individual skills but also teamwork and strategic thinking to the limit. They might be as short as a single foe or a long, arduous adventure taking several evenings to finish. One thing will be certain however, you will die and you will have to adapt to each new situation.

In the alpha there are currently two challenges, still not connected to any particular norse lore but mainly in place in order to showcase game mechanics.

<i>The first, proper challenge: Winter Wonderland. A single foe, the frost shaman Grynma, with numerous hazards to take into consideration when fighting.</i></p>

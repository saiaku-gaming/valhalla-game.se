title: Character Progression

One thing we feel modern games are doing wrong today is having a progression where the character gets strictly better the further into the game you progress. The problem with this is that even a player who is good at the game is being arbitrarily locked out of content because he or she is lacking "good enough stats" to properly tackle the challenge.

In Valhall, in order to get better in one regard you also have to become worse in another regard. You don't become strictly better, you become more specialized.

## Skills and abilities
In order to spice things up in Valhall the gods lend out gifts, empowering the fallen vikings in certain ways. However, a person can only get so strong before the gods refuse to give him more power, unless he's willing to also bear some curses that is.

The idea with this skill system is to allow even new players to be somewhat on par evern with the most experienced einharjer. They'll obviously lack a bit of a punch since a specialized warrior is way better than someone who's a jack of all trades, but they won't get outright obliterated at least.

title: Download our Alpha

Currently valhalla is a windows only game and in really early alpha. Don't expect anything to work and there is a high chance that the game will be broken (or turn your computer into a Decepticon and kill everyone).

Our latest installer is always available [here](http://valhalla-game.com/public/setup.exe)

You can also download the [patcher](http://valhalla-game.com/public/patcher/patcher.exe), put it in an empty folder and start it if you do not want to use the installer.

title: Download our Alpha
---

Currently valhalla is a Windows only game and in really early alpha. Don't expect anything to work and there is a high chance that the game will be broken (or turn your computer into a Decepticon and kill everyone).

There is an installer that can be found [here](http://valhalla-game.com/public/setup.exe) and this is the recommended way to get the game.

Anouther way to get the game is to download the [patcher](http://valhalla-game.com/public/patcher/startup.exe), put it in an empty folder and start it. It will download all needed files for running the game. Do this if the installer for some reason wont work for you. 

[Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) is a requirement for the game. Follow the link if you think you need it (the game will tell you when you try to start it), most people already have it installed.

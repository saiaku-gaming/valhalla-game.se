title: Download our Alpha
---

Currently valhalla is a Windows only game and in really early alpha. Don't expect anything to work and there is a high chance that the game will be broken (or turn your computer into a Decepticon and kill everyone).

Currently recommended way to get the game is to download the [patcher](http://http://valhalla-game.com/public/patcher/startup.exe), put it in an empty folder and start it. It will download all needed files for running the game.

[Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) is a requirement for the game. Follow the link if you think you need it (the game will tell you when you try to start it), most people already have it installed.

There is an installer that can be found [here](http://valhalla-game.com/public/setup.exe) but it is currently a bit buggy so the patcher is preferred.

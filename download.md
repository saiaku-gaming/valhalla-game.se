###Installer

Download the ***[Installer](http://valhalla-game.com/public/setup.exe)***. This is the recommended way to get the game as it ensures you have the required dependencies needed to run the game.


###Or download the files directly with the patcher

Another way to get the game is to download the [patcher](http://valhalla-game.com/public/patcher/startup.exe), put it in an empty folder and start it. It will download all the needed files to running the game. This way you only get the files you need and can just delete the folder when you want to uninstall it.

If you install via the patcher then you might need the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) as its a requirement for the game. Follow the link if you think you need it (the game will tell you when you try to start it), most people already have it installed.

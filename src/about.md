title: About the game
---
The game is set in a universe where all people who die in battle ends up in Valhalla. There you will entertain the gods
while testing your skills in different challenges. It is the gods who need entertainment and you are it. Show them that
you are a cunning warrior!

##Inspiration

The game takes inspiration from MMORPGS, the instances and dungeons from WoW, GuildWars etc. Our focus is an RPG where 
you and your friends can come together and beat different instances, with an emphasis on cooperation, exploration and
 adaptation. Hardcore gameplay are our core values, meaning firendly fire, quick melee fighting and seriously hard 
 challenges.

Jump straight into the action beginning with campaigns and unravel what's currently going on in the world of the Ã¦sirs. 
No need for grind or arbitrary level requirements; if you and your party are skilled enough you will be able to 
progress. However, specializing your roles will be beneficial.

##Cooperation
The combat is quick and often quite chaotic; good communication and quick adaptation is often of the essence. 
Sometimes the party is better off going together, while at other times it might be better to spread out across the map 
in smaller groups, doing things simultaneously while synchronizing with each other.

*Example of what a fight might look like, this time it was a 4v4 PvP fight spontaneously occurring in Valhalla*

##Some random notes:

* Built by three people in their spare time.
* Built on [Unreal Engine 4](http://unreal.com)
* The game is really early alpha, don't expect it to work.
* Any feedback is always welcome!

Will we be seeing you in Valhalla?

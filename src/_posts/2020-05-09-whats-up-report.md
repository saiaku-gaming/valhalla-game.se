It was a long time since we last posted here! But it is not because we have stopped working on the game!

## Quick update

The reason why stopped posting is simple. We are putting all our focus on the game and let this page sleep for a while.
 
And it will probably continue to sleep while we focus on the game. Once the game is nearing a test-stage we will
be more active here and on other social platforms. But in the meantime. Please just stay tight and wait. :)

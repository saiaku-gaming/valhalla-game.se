During July we released a new map, added curses and improved combat mechanics as well as UI clarity!

## Missveden
After some playtesting further playtesting of Fredstorp, and feedback we received, we got the impression that Fredstorp was too difficult for a first map. In order to ease new players in even more we created Missveden, which will be the first chapter in our first campaign, preluding Fredstorp!

## Curses are back!
Curses have finally found their way back to Valhalla. The way they work is they hinder the player in certain aspects but unlock points for the player to grow in other areas. Curses will be an essential part of the levelling experience in order to not make the characters strictly stronger the further they progress.

Apart from this we've also reintroduced attributes which will boost, or hinder, the character in different ways as well as affect your amount of health, stamina and mana. They are split into pairs, with one offensive and one defensive: Strength/Endurance, Agility/Mobility, Intelligence/Wisdom. Whenever you claim a gift or a curse, you will also have to pick an attribute bonus (positive for gifts, negative for curses)

## Blocking and parrying
We've made some updates to the blocking and parrying mechanics which makes them feel a lot more responsive. We've also added a timing mechanic for the blocking, so the longer you just mindlessly hold your shield or weapon raised, the less effective it will be.

*Whenever you start blocking or parrying, a circle around your crosshair will appear indicating how long you have blocked for. The fuller the circle, and the redder it is, the worse your block/parry will be*

## Preparations for SGA
This year we applied for Swedish Game Awards but sadly did not get nominated. However, in preparation for this we created a trailer, got help with creating concept art and in general tried to polish the UI and clarity in the game. However, the work will continue as usual, with the goal of having a complete first campaign before the year is over!

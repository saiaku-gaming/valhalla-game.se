The game is only accessible though [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and is invite only.

If you are interested in getting a key, send us an email at [info@teamsamst.com](mailto://info@teamsamst.com)!

##Getting started

Once you have gotten a key from us you need to register it and the game will appear in your library.

IMPORTANT!

The main release branch is only updated when we have something big, but the developer branch is updated every night!
So if you want to test the latest and greatest you need to switch to the developer beta channel. You do this under the 
properties page.

</a>

Under the BETAS tab select development.

## Once in the game
The game is NOT complete in any sense. This is a really early alpha, and for this reason the tutorial is kinda lame and
some stuff might be a bit confusing. But don't worry! We are going to inform you on some the confusing things here below:

### Where are the menus?
While in game, press escape to see all the different menus available and their shortcut.

### X is broken, and Y is strange!
While this is an early alpha so a lot of things are expected to be broken,
 don't hesitate to poke us about it at: [info@teamsamst.com](mailto://info@teamsamst.com)!

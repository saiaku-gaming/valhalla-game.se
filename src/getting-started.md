IMPORTANT!

Before you can play you need to switch to the developer beta channel to get the lastest working version. You do this under the properties page.

##Once in the game

The game is NOT complete in any sense. This is a really early alpha, and for this reason we don't have a tutorial and some stuff might be a bit confusing. But don't worry! We are going to inform you on all the confusing things here below:

### Why do I need to create an account?
We don't have a finished integration with steam yet. It will go away, but in the meantime. Just do it!

### Nothing happens when I try to move on from the character selection screen?
Our servers are automatically shutting down if no one is playing, and starting them can take up to 15 minutes. So just be patient and try to login again.

<div style="float: right; text-align: center; margin: 2em">
	<a href="/images/getting-started/valhalla1.png" class="image-link"><img style="width:20em; margin: 0;" src="/images/getting-started/valhalla1.png" /></a>
	<br />
	<i>The escape menu</i>
</div>
### Wheres the menus?
While in game, press escape to see all the different menus savailable and their shortcut.


### What's there to do?
Grab som friends and try to finish our only dungeon called Fredstorp, or venture in alone if you really like the challenge! 

### X is broken, and Y is strange!
Join the teamspeak and talk to us about it! While this is an early alpha so a lot of things are expected to be broken, don't hesitate to poke us about it! Or if you want do feedback oldschool-style then there is always our email: [info@teamsamst.com](mailto://info@teamsamst.com)!

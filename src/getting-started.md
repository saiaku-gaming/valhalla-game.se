##Once in the game

The game is NOT complete in any sense. This is a really early alpha, and for this reason we don't have a tutorial and some stuff might be a bit confusing. But don't worry! We are going to inform you on all the confusing things here below:

### Why do I need to create an account?
We don't have a finished integration with steam yet. It will go away, but in the meantime. Just do it!

### Wheres the menus?
While in game, press escape to see all the different menues available and their shortcut.

### What's there to do?
Grab som friends and try to finish our only dungeon called Fredstorp, or venture in alone if you really like the challange! 

### X is broken, and Y is strange!
Join the teamspeak and talk to us about it! While this is an early alpha so a lot of things are expected to be broken, dont hesitate to poke us about it!

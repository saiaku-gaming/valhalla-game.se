We're using the same mantra as pretty much every other computer RPG out there: we want you to focus on the game, not stare at cooldowns etc etc. What we're doing differently however is forcing the player to play an even more active role in interacting with the environment.

###So what are we doing differently?
	
* Hits are based on where your weapon hits (duh). If the enemy has their shield up to the right, make sure to strike from the left side. If they're attacking you, strike where their weapon is coming from and parry the blow.
* Many of the ranged spells and attacks are skill shots, so be sure to take gravity and velocity into consideration when aiming!
* The AI reacts to what you're doing, trying to stick together in fights, running away and getting backup if it's feeling too threatened or hiding from you if you broke its morale.
* The AI moves and tries to intercept your movement, tries to surround you and if possible tries getting in strikes from behind. Move together as a team and position yourselves intelligently!
* And of course, everything can affect everyone. Be careful not to stick your sword in the back of your shield mate, or accidently empower the enemy einh√§rjer charging towards you.

*The way hit detection works is by using a, now common, technique where the weapon consists of several sockets. Every frame there's a trace between the sockets' last and current positions, hitting everything in between.*

*Simple combat, featuring the berserker trial in the demo map where the goal is to defeat the berserker AI*

*More advanced combat, featuring the defense trial in the demo map where the goal is to survive three waves of incoming attackers.*

*A quick showcase of how the AI moves around. Every AI controller has a point which "floats around" in the world which is where the character wants to move to. The point is illustrated by the white dot seen in the video.*

The rules for where the point flows to is pretty simple:

1. Run towards the target
2. If something's in your way, flow to the left of it if you're on the left side, otherwise flow to the right of it.
3. If the target is too close (range defined by weapon and some other parameters) move back a bit
4. If the target is moving, try to intercept it

Done entirely using Unreal Engine 4 blueprints.

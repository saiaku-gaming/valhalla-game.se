It's about time! Time to do a small demo of the game and find all the bugs that always show up while doing a demo. 

<!--excerpt_separator-->

So join us in playing our first demo this sunday at 18:00 and experience all that the game has to offer (including all the bugs!). :P

Soon there will be a lot more content appearing on this page but if you are curious about the game then please come by and play some!

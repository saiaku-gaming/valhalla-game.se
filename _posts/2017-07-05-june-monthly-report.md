A project cannot survive as long as this has without a few problems and some major changes along the way.

<!--excerpt_separator-->

 It's probably a good thing as it shows that stuff is happening. But now we are doing more than just stuff, we are reporting about it as well! Starting with this month we decided to do a small report on all the things that we have managed to create (or destroy).

## Chat
There's finally a chat system! It has the pretty standard functions of a general chat (visible to everyone everywhere), an instance chat (visible only to players in the same instance), a party chat (only visible to your party members) and a whisper function to certain players.

## New map in progress: Fredstorp
The first single player challenge is being worked on: Fredstorp. This small bay is, despite it's name, home of several pillagers in Midgård. With the new æsir powers bestowed upon them, the player gets a first easy challenge being sent back to the land of men, battling regular human bandits. Searching the cave systems and infiltrating the outpost is a great way of earning your first items to put in your wardrobe.

## Feedback from playtest
We gained a lot of valuable feedback from the latest play testing and put a lot of effort trying to make the combat feel smoother and more responsive. This was done by tweaking how the hit detection works, how animations blend into each other and the structure of the animation state machine. After inviting a few of the same players again they were very positive to the changes =)

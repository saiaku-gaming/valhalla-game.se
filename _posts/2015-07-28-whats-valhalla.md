# Why do we want to make yet another (M)MORPG.

This is the first post in what hopefully will be a series of post where I will try to explain what's wrong with the current big MMORPGs out there and explain the design decisions we are taking while making our game. 

Or rather, I will begin by taking a small part of our game design and explain how and why it differs from the other games currently available. In this take, I will focus on the basic kind of [grinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_%28video_gaming%29) that exists in all MMORPGs and *why the hell we do it*?

## Is Grinding fun?

Remember when you played World of Warcraft and some quest giver said: "I need X amount of the item Y" or "Kill X amount if the creature Y"? My guess is that every player that have played MMORPGs have encountered way to many quests of that kind. 

The basic premises is that you are given a quest or challenge and you gain a reward that you want; usually the main component is experience. But was the quest the fun part of WoW? I don't think so. Did you feel joy when you killed the 10th boar and it finally has a [ribcage](http://www.wowhead.com/item=2677/boar-ribs#dropped-by) (yeah, most of the boars in WoW are lacking rib cages)?

What happened to me at least was the same feeling as when vacuuming the floor, that is, it feels good having done the task, not doing it. I did not want to kill boars. I did not want to circle around waiting for a new ribbless boar to spawn. And I really really did not care that the NPC had such an urgent need for boar ribs that he sent everyone he encountered on a quest for them. All I wanted was progress for some reason. It might have been the story that intrigued me or I wanted to get to the end game to see the dungeons, or it might have been as easy as I was playing with a friend and grinding quests in WoW was just a pastime activity that fitted well into the jibber-jabber with my friends.

## Is Grinding progress?

Grinding is often tied to questing and progress of things like map exploration and storyline. That is, to make the story progress you are often forced to make a lot of meaningless tasks from NPCs. If those task was hard there would at least be a feeling of accomplishment tied to it, but usually in MMORPGs the tasks are quite simple. I believe this is to cater to the casual player. It's important to note that grinding is enabling everyone to be maxed out in the end. No matter how casual. This is an important part game design that makes sure that everyone can partake in everything. Unfortunately that also means that the casual players effectively controls the difficulty of a big part of the game.

But there is some advantages from grinding. Grinding can make you optimize and learn a lot of things such as:
    - skills effectiveness
    - damage control
    - character movement

It is a slow and steady way to learn the abilities and game mechanics in the game. So by removing the grinding we need to find some alternative way for making adjustments to the learning curve.

## How to solve the problem.

The other MMORPGs out there have noticed the problem as well and some managed to fix it better than others.

WoW rested system.


- Eve Onlines learning in real time.
- Guild Wars low level and stuff like dynamic events.

# Why do we want to make yet another (M)MORPG.

This is the first post in what hopefully will be a series of post where I will try to explain what's wrong with the current big MMORPGs out there and explain the design decisions we are taking while making our game. 

Or rather, I will begin by taking a small part of our game design and explain how and why it differs from the other games currently available. In this take, I will focus on the basic kind of [grinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_%28video_gaming%29) that exists in all MMORPGs and *why the hell we do it*?

## Is Grinding fun?

Remember when you played World of Warcraft and some quest giver said: "I need X amount of the item Y" or "Kill X amount if the creature Y"? My guess is that every player that have played MMORPGs have encountered way to many quests of that kind. 

The basic premises is that you are given a quest or challenge and you gain a reward that you want; usually the main component is experience. But was the quest the fun part of WoW? I don't think so. Did you feel joy when you killed the 10th boar and it finally has a [ribcage](http://www.wowhead.com/item=2677/boar-ribs#dropped-by) (yeah, most of the boars in WoW are lacking rib cages)?

What happened to me at least was the same feeling as when vacuuming the floor, that is, it feels good having done the task, not doing it. I did not want to kill boars. I did not want to circle around waiting for a new ribbless boar to spawn. And I really really did not care that the NPC had such an urgent need for boar ribs that he sent everyone he encountered on a quest for them. All I wanted was progress for some reason. It might have been the story that intrigued me or I wanted to get to the end game to see the dungeons, or it might have been as easy as I was playing with a friend and grinding quests in WoW was just a pastime activity that fitted well into the jibber-jabber with my friends.

## Is Grinding progress?

Grinding is often tied to questing and progress of things like map exploration and storyline. That is, to make the story progress you are often forced to make a lot of meaningless tasks from NPCs. If those task was hard there would at least be a feeling of accomplishment tied to it, but usually in MMORPGs the tasks are quite simple. I believe this is to cater to the casual player. It's important to note that grinding is enabling everyone to be maxed out in the end. No matter how casual. This is an important part game design that makes sure that everyone can partake in everything. Unfortunately that also means that the casual players effectively controls the difficulty of a big part of the game.

But there is some advantages from grinding. Grinding can make you optimize and learn a lot of things such as:
    - skills effectiveness
    - damage control
    - character movement

It is a slow and steady way to learn the abilities and game mechanics in the game. So by removing the grinding we need to find some alternative way for making adjustments to the learning curve.

## How to solve the problem.

The other MMORPGs out there have noticed the problem as well and some managed to fix it better than others.

The rested system introduced in WoW was In my opinion the strangest of moves. What it means is that if you don't play often you can effectively need to grind only half as much as you are rested and receives twice as much experience for everything. While this might be a healthy way to go at it (making sure that the games takes pauses). It does not really fix the issue at hand.

Eve Onlines has some strange game mechanic that works like this:

1. Press the button to learn something.
2. Wait in realtime (you don't need to be in game).
3. ..
4. Profit

It's a way to make learning something realistic that it takes time (kinda), but it does not require anything of the player other than waiting and of course making sure to learn the right stuff as you cannot learn stuff in parallel.

Guild Wars did a different take on the solution, first and foremost the game is quick to level up to max level and it's easy to get the best gear. That is statistically the best gear. People have spent an eternity to get most aesthetic pleasing sword, and Legendary weapons in Guild Wars is really awesome as you can see below: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrBbD2L37xM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So while you still could grind in Guild Wars, it was fairly quick and painless. And with the addition of jump puzzles, dynamic events, and a fairly good storyline the Guild Wars grind experience kinda worked.

## Our solution!

Just do the fun part. Guild Wars was on the right track, but they did not push it far enough. We only want to have the instance gaming (single player or dungeons with lots of people) and the only grinding possible would be mass doing instances. No more waiting for something to spawn or needing 10 random items. Every instance will have a real reason behind it and a (hard to achieve) goal.

But how to we keep "the good parts", well thats something we haven't decided yet and I think that is going to be one of the big challenges for us.

So what we need to figure out right now is:

1. How do we slowly introduce the player to skills so that the learning curve wont be to steep.
2. Same thing with other game mechanics, specially with regards to UI feedback.

We do believe that we don't need to introduce the player to the basics of moving etc. as the gamers that are going to find this game probably already have spent some time in one of the many MMOs out there.

So in the end we are going to make the bold move to only keep the instances from MMORPGs and just throw away all the prelude that every other game keep on insisting is necessary and I do believe we can pull it of.

# Why do we want to make yet another MMORPG.

This is the first post in what hopefully will be a series of post where I will try to explain what's wrong with the current big MMORPGs out there and explain the design decisions we are taking while making our game. 

Or rather, I will begin by taking a small part of our game design and explain how and why it differs from the other games currently available. In this take, I will focus on the basic kind of [grinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_%28video_gaming%29) that exists in all MMORPGs and why the hell we do it.

## Grinding is often tied to questing and progress of things like map exploration and storyline progress.

Remember when you played World of Warcraft and some quest giver said: "I need X amout of the item Y" or "Kill X amout if the creature Y"? I guess we all do. 

The basic premises is that you are given a quest or challenge and you gain a reward that you want; usually the main component is experience. But was the quest the fun part of WoW? I don't think so. Did you feel joy when you killed the 10th boar and it finally has a [ribcage](http://www.wowhead.com/item=2677/boar-ribs#dropped-by) (Yeah, most of the boars in WoW are lacking rib cages)? 

What happened to me at least was a feeling of satisfaction that the number of items increased closer to the number needed to stop doing what I was doing. I did not want to kill boars, I wanted to get experience to get the skills to continue to play. I did not want to circle around waiting for a new ribbless boar to spawn. And I really really did not care that the NPC had such an urgent need for boar ribs that he sent everyone he encountered on a quest for them.




The grinding in



To make this at least somewhat interesting I will begin by stating a couple of important things:

* Grinding can be rewarding but is it fun?
* Grinding can make you optimize and learn a lot of things such as:
    - skills effectiveness
    - damage control
    - character movement
    - etc etc.
